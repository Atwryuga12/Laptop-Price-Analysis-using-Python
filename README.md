# Laptop-Price-Analysis-using-Python

## Situation:
With the rapidly evolving technology market, understanding the factors that influence laptop pricing has become crucial for both manufacturers and consumers. The aim of this project was to analyze a dataset of laptops to uncover patterns and insights that drive pricing decisions, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## Task:
The primary task was to clean, explore, and analyze a dataset containing various attributes of laptops, such as brand, specifications, and prices. The goal was to:
Identify key features that significantly affect laptop prices.
Provide actionable insights through visualizations.
Summarize trends and relationships in the dataset.

## Action:

### Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Standardized and transformed features for analysis.
Ensured that all 1,275 entries and 23 features were complete and ready for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted correlation analysis to identify significant relationships between features.
Created insightful visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Analyzed the distribution of key attributes, including RAM, storage, weight, and screen size.

### Feature Engineering:
Derived new attributes, such as aspect ratios and price per GB of storage, for deeper insights.

### Visualization and Reporting:
Highlighted trends such as brand influence and the impact of RAM, storage type, and processor type on pricing.
Presented findings using dashboards and charts.

## Result:
The project provided the following key insights and outcomes:
Brand Impact: Premium brands such as Apple and Dell command higher prices, even for similar specifications.
Specifications Influence: RAM size, storage type (SSD vs. HDD), and processor speed were identified as major contributors to pricing variance.
Screen and Weight: Laptops with larger screens and lighter weights tend to have higher prices, indicating a preference for portability and display quality.
Visualization Impact: Presented actionable insights that manufacturers and consumers can leverage, such as the optimal configuration for value-based pricing.

## Key Metrics:
Dataset Size: 1,275 entries and 23 features.
Missing Values: 0% after preprocessing.
Correlation Coefficients: Significant correlations include RAM and Price (+0.76), SSD Storage and Price (+0.65).
Visualization Tools: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), with over 10 visualizations created.
This analysis equips stakeholders with a data-driven understanding of laptop pricing dynamics, enabling better market positioning and purchase decisions.
